Overview
============

This is a Jira plugin allowing you to integrate Slack channels and Jira issues in an easy and non-intrusive way (much like what Atlassian do with hipchat)

From any Jira issue, you can:
* create a Slack channel to discuss the issue
* automatically invite reporter, assignees, commenters, project lead
* see the activity from within Jira and jump directly in the discussion

How to compile
============
This plugin works with Jira 7 (tested with 7.1.7 & 7.2.1 & 7.6.3 & 7.6.10).

In order to compile the code and a deployable plugin, you need to have Atlassian Plugin development kit installed and working on your machine (see https://developer.atlassian.com/docs/getting-started). The initial release was built using version 6.1.0

A few commands worth noting:
* atlas-mvn eclipse:eclipse to build an Eclipse-importable project
* atlas-package to compile & generate a plugin jar file


Installation
============

# How to deploy to your Jira instance
* Copy the template properties file (jira-slackit.model.properties) on your Jira server and rename it jira-slackit.properties
* Update it with proper values
* In your Jira web interface, go in Administration > Add-ons > Manage add-ons and upload the jar file
* Check in the logs for any error (you will have at least one error as you need to create a 'slack' custom field, that's covered in the Configuration below) 


# Configuration
All configuration is done directly in the properties file. Current values and reload actions are possible from the Administration section of Jira > Add-ons > Slack-it
* Once deployed, you need to create a custom field of type 'Slack channel custom field'. This custom field will store the Slack channel id associated to an issue
* You will need to edit the properties to add the id of this custom field and reload the configuration and you are all set
